Dev Data Products Course Project

This Project is a kind of test for beginners with shiny.

[Here it is](https://cyrg38.shinyapps.io/DevDataProducts/) 

We create plots and texts renderings about the __mtcars__ dataset (from default R __datasets__ package).

One has to choose only one outcome (vertical y-axis), and one regressor (horizontal x-axis).

We did a regression model of "y ~ x" but we weren't able to render the formula in the "Summary" tab.

The third tab consist of the mtcars table restricted to the chosen variables.

An extension of this project could be to :
- first, create some dynamic selection of variables,
- second, add other regressor's variable,
- third, compare and show results of linear models.

Due to short time frame, we were not able to progress much on this side.
